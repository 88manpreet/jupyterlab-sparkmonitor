# A DistROOT Example

## Introduction
One of the main goals of this project was to enable the scientific community in leveraging the power of distributed computing for scientific analysis. ROOT is a popular library based on C++ used for various scientific analysis tasks.
This example use case for the SparkMonitor extension, uses the DistROOT module to process ROOT TTree objects in a distributed cluster using Apache Spark.

# Environment
- This use case was tested on a 4 node spark cluster running on the CERN IT Infrastructure.
- A beta version of SWAN - a jupyterhub based notebook service was used with the SparkMonitor extension installed
- The data was uploaded to a central storage service and accessed from the cluster.

# Notebooks 
- The DistROOT example notebook can be found [here](DistROOT.ipynb)

# Monitoring
